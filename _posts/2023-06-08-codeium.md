title: "Codeium: A first attempt"

[Codeium](https://codeium.com/) is a free AI-powered toolkit for developers. It is backed by the commercial team [ExaFunction](https://exafunction.com/). It provides official integration with many popular editors - including [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/). This post makes a brief description on how was my experience while coding the [messagepack refactor](https://vlopes11.github.io/msgpacker-refactor/) with Codeium enabled.

I favor Codeium over other tools, mainly because it is providing a free and open-source toolkit for developers. While other tools will charge per usage, they will also profit from the training data we provide as we consume the tool.

## Setup

The setup is quite simple, and it involves creating an account on their website, verifying an email, and getting a token API. My NeoVim configuration is also straightforward, and is copy&paste from their suggestion:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('i', '<C-g>', function () return vim.fn['codeium#Accept']() end, { expr = true })
vim.keymap.set('i', '<c-;>', function() return vim.fn['codeium#CycleCompletions'](1) end, { expr = true })
vim.keymap.set('i', '<c-,>', function() return vim.fn['codeium#CycleCompletions'](-1) end, { expr = true })
vim.keymap.set('i', '<c-x>', function() return vim.fn['codeium#Clear']() end, { expr = true })
```

I stick their default 500ms delay to render suggestions (i.e. `let g:codeium_idle_delay = 500`). This provides a somewhat smooth experience without too much interference from annoying suggestions, as more than that might be annoying and disrupt a train of thought.

## Code suggestions

I produced a total of 2315 lines of code with the refactor; from these, I accepted 357 code suggestions. Most of the suggestions needed some reviewing, but they helped a lot with boilerplate and repeated code situations. It was particularly useful to write tests, as in the example below:

It works very well for continuation code. Here, it predicts the target `u32` type, and the `5` bytes consumption (4 of the `u32` and 1 for the format tag):

It also performs a quite decent job on document short snippets and unsafe usage:

However, the core of the code will have to be written manually for correctness. It will be most helpful to complete, but the process of writing function skeletons & API is still responsibility of the developer.

## Conclusion

Overall, my experience is positive. I'll continue using it, and will expect it to help me writing documentation, tests, and boilerplate code.
